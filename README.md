This repository contains ECG - an open-source library for assisting in diagnostics of heart conditions from ECG. This library provides functionality of heart condition detection, differential diagnostics, and risk markers evaluation. The library handles ECGs in both formats, as signal or as a photo.

## Project Description

### ECG Features
Main features implemented in the library
1. Recognition of ECG signal from a photo of printed ECG
1. Detection of ST-elevation
1. IM risk markers evaluation
1. IM/BER differential diagnosis

Thus compared to other frameworks, ECG:
* Handles ECGs provised as a signal as well as an image
* Provides a range of functionality useful for IM diagnostics

    $ conda activate ECG
    ```
1. install requirements from [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
1. install the library as a package
    ```
